## Milestone 3: Backend Development

### Features Implemented:
1. **Backend Folder Structure**: Organized folders for routes, controllers, models, middlewares, and utils.
2. **Server Setup**: Configured a Node.js server with Express.
3. **MongoDB Integration**: Connected the backend to a MongoDB database for storing product data.
4. **Error Handling**: Added custom middleware for centralized error handling and better debugging.

### API Endpoints:
1. `GET /api/products` - Fetch all products.
2. `GET /api/products/:id` - Fetch a single product by ID.
3. `POST /api/products` - Add a new product.

### Next Steps:
1. Add more API endpoints (e.g., Update and Delete).
2. Implement user authentication and authorization.
3. Connect the backend to the frontend.
