# E-Commerce Backend

Welcome to the E-Commerce Backend project! This is a Node.js-based backend for an e-commerce application that connects to MongoDB to manage product data. This backend handles basic CRUD operations for products and sets up the foundation for further development.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account to connect to a remote database
- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd ecommerce-app/Backend


# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

This repository contains the backend code for an e-commerce website built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Multer** for file uploads.

## Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller

### Overview
In **Milestone 4**, we focused on creating a user model, implementing a user controller to handle user registration and login, and adding support for file uploads using **Multer**. The following key features were achieved in this milestone:

- **User Model:** A MongoDB schema was created to handle user data, including fields like `name`, `email`, `password`, and `profileImage`.
- **User Controller:** Functions were created for user registration, login, and user profile update.
- **File Upload (Multer):** We integrated **Multer** to handle file uploads, particularly for storing user profile images.
- **API Routes:** Created routes to handle user-related operations (e.g., registration, login, profile update) with proper validation and error handling.

### What Was Implemented
1. **User Model:** We created a Mongoose model with validation rules.
2. **User Controller:** Functions were developed for user registration, authentication, and profile handling.
3. **Multer Support:** Integrated Multer for handling file uploads, particularly for storing profile pictures.
